# P5.js Interactive Sketch Suite with QuickSettings

A collection of browser-ready, canvas-based experiments and demos built with p5.js. Each sketch showcases different algorithms, generative techniques, and classic arcade-style interactions, all wired to an integrated QuickSettings-style UI for real-time parameter tweaking. The repository emphasizes practical, runnable examples you can open in a browser and freely explore or remix.

Note: This README focuses on what the project can do, practical usage, and how the components work together. It does not cover setup or installation steps.

## Project Overview

- A compact suite of interactive sketches built with p5.js (JavaScript) that demonstrate:
  - Cellular automata (Game of Life)
  - Classic arcade-style interactions (Snake, Space Invaders)
  - Procedural content generation (island/island-like terrains, noise-driven worlds)
  - Flow-field particle systems
  - Fractals and L-systems (trees/branching)
  - Web-based UI controls via QuickSettings-inspired utilities
- Each sketch is designed to be opened directly in a browser via its HTML wrapper and accompanying JavaScript files.
- A common UI paradigm (QuickSettings-like) is embedded to manipulate parameters in real-time, making experiments interactive and repeatable.

  - Sliders, color pickers, dropdowns, buttons, and more to adjust sketch behavior on the fly.
- Multiple runnable examples (each with its own HTML wrapper)
  - The Game of Life
  - Snake
  - Space Invaders
  - General-purpose "Sketch" demos (islands, procedural generation, fractals, etc.)
- Procedural generation demos
  - Island/terrain generation with noise, falloff, center boosts, and preset color palettes
  - Palette-driven color mappings for natural terrain feel
- Flow-field and particle systems
  - Particles following a generated flow field
- L-systems and branching structures
  - Recursive growth patterns and tree-like visuals
- Utility helpers
  - 2D array/grid utilities for coding cell/graph structures
  - Lightweight, self-contained QuickSettings-like UI toolkit integrated in sketches
- Lightweight, browser-first experience
  - Open HTML files in any modern browser; no server required

---

## How It Works (Architecture Overview)

- Each sketch is an HTML wrapper that loads:
  - p5.js and related libraries
  - A specific sketch script (e.g., sketch.js, snake.js, ship.js, etc.)
  - Optional utility scripts (e.g., QuickSettings-like UI, color helpers, island generator components)
- Core utilities and architecture
  - 2D grid helpers (Make2DArray, index calculations) to manage cellular automata and grid-based games
  - Entities and state machines for games (Snake, Ship, Enemies, etc.)
  - Procedural generator modules (noise-based island generator, color settings, presets)
  - A QuickSettings-like API that enables real-time parameter binding to sketch state
- UI integration
  - The QuickSettings-like interface provides a consistent way to expose parameters to the user
  - Panels can be created, values saved to local storage, and values bound to in-sketch state

## Core Components & Features in Detail

- Game of Life (Life-like cellular automaton)
  - Grid-based initial random state
  - Update loop applying standard Life rules
  - Real-time visualization with simple rendering

- Island/Procedural Generator
  - Noise-based terrain generation with falloff from the center
  - Center-height boost and adjustable falloff

  - Presets for various island archetypes (Mountain Island, Volcanic Island, Coral Atoll, etc.)
- Flow Field + Particles
  - Particles follow a vector field generated by noise
  - Flow field updates and particle rendering
- Fractals & L-Systems
  - Tree-like branching, turtle-graphics style growth, and recursive branching
- Additional Sketches
  - Various sketch examples (Maze-like generation, cellular automata variations, and more) demonstrated via their own HTML wrappers
- UI & Binding
  - A QuickSettings-like API for creating controls, binding them to sketch state, and saving/restoring configurations

---

## Practical Usage Examples

- How to run a sketch
  - Open any of the HTML wrappers in a browser, e.g.:
    - TheGameofLife.html
    - Snake.html
    - SpaceInvaders.html
    - Sketch.html (various demos)
  - Each HTML loads its corresponding JavaScript (sketch.js, ship.js, etc.) and the p5.js libraries
- QuickSettings-style panel usage (conceptual)
  - Create a panel at a given position with a title and parent element
  - Add controls (range, number, color, dropdown, etc.)
  - Bind changes to your sketch state or run callbacks
  - Save and restore values via local storage
- Example: Island Generator panel (concept)
  - Create an island generator panel
  - Bind sliders to generator.noiseScale, generator.falloffStrength, generator.centerHeightMultiplier, etc.
  - Bind color palette selections to terrain color mappings
  - Use preset names to quickly switch between island configurations

Code-style examples (illustrative; adapt to the repository’s actual codebase)

- QuickSettings-like panel creation
  - You would typically do something like:
    - const panel = QuickSettings.create(x, y, "Island Generator", document.body);
    - panel.addRange("noiseScale", 0.001, 0.02, 0.003, 0.001, v => { generator.noiseScale = v; });
    - panel.addRange("falloffStrength", 0, 1, 0.5, 0.01, v => { generator.falloffStrength = v; });
    - panel.addColor("deepOcean", "#123456", v => { generator.colorSettings.deepOcean = v; });
    - panel.saveInLocalStorage("island-gen-save");
- Running a Life-like grid
  - In setup, initialize a 2D grid with random states
  - In draw, for each cell, compute next state based on neighbors
  - Render each cell as a small rectangle, with color representing alive/dead
- Island presets (high-level)
  - A GeneratorSettings class holds presets like MountainIsland, VolcanicIsland, CoralAtoll, etc.
  - You can apply a preset with generator.applyPreset("MountainIsland") and then tweak with the UI

Note: The actual code in the repository provides concrete implementations of these patterns, exposed through HTML wrappers and JavaScript modules.

## Getting Started (What to Open)

- Open any of the provided HTML wrappers in your browser:

  - Snake.html
  - SpaceInvaders.html
  - Sketch.html (multi-demo canvas)
- Each wrapper loads its own sketch.js (and related modules)
- Interact with the on-page UI to adjust parameters in real-time

---

## Practical Tips

- Experiment with presets
  - Island generator presets enable quick exploration of different terrain styles
- Save and restore
  - Use the local storage features of the QuickSettings-like UI to preserve preferred configurations
- Use the 2D grid helpers
  - For any grid-based simulation, leverage the provided Make2DArray and index helpers to manage cells efficiently
- Extend or remix
  - The modular structure makes it straightforward to add new sketches or reuse the UI layer to expose custom parameters

---

## Limitations & Considerations

- Browser-based, client-side only
  - No server-side processing or persistence beyond local storage
- Depending on the sketch, performance may vary with canvas size and CPU/GPU capability
- The included QuickSettings-like UI is lightweight and designed for educational and exploratory use

If you’d like, I can:
- Create a compact, ready-to-run starter example showing how to wire a new sketch with the QuickSettings UI
- Produce a quick-start cheat-sheet mapping common UI calls to their effects in the repo
- Extend this README with a catalog of all the specific sketches present (with short one-liners for what each does) once you share which wrappers you want highlighted.
