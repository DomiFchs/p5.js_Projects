# P5.js Interactive Sketch Suite with QuickSettings-style UI

A browser-first collection of runnable p5.js sketches demonstrating classic simulations, procedural content generation, and interactive visuals. Each sketch is wrapped in its own HTML file and loads a dedicated JavaScript module (sketch.js, snake.js, ship.js, etc.). A lightweight QuickSettings-inspired UI is embedded to expose parameters in real time, bind them to sketch state, and optionally persist configurations to localStorage.

What this project can do for you
- Quickly explore and remix a variety of interactive demos without a server
- See real-time parameter tweaking through a consistent UI across sketches
- Insulate UI logic from sketch logic so you can focus on algorithms and visuals
- Bind UI controls to any sketch property (numbers, colors, booleans, strings, dates, files, etc.)
- Save and restore UI state across sessions
- Use island/terrain presets, flow-fields, L-systems, cellular automata, and arcade-style games all in one repo

Usage scenarios and practical examples

- Example 1: Island generator panel
  - Purpose: tweak terrain generation parameters and color palettes in real time
  - Typical code (illustrative):
    - Open IslandGenerator-related HTML wrapper (e.g., IslandGenerator.html)
    - Bindings (via QuickSettings-like API):
      - panel = QuickSettings.create(10, 10, "IslandGenerator", document.body)
      - panel.addRange("noiseScale", 0.001, 0.02, 0.003, 0.001, v => { generator.noiseScale = v })
      - panel.addRange("falloffStrength", 0, 1, 0.5, 0.01, v => { generator.falloffStrength = v })
      - panel.addRange("centerHeightMultiplier", 0.5, 4.0, 1.5, 0.1, v => { generator.centerHeightMultiplier = v })
      - panel.addRange("centerRadius", 0.1, 0.9, 0.4, 0.05, v => { generator.centerRadius = v })
      - panel.addColor("deepOcean", "#123456", v => { generator.colorSettings.deepOcean = v })
      - panel.saveInLocalStorage("island-gen-save")
  - What you get: a live-updating terrain preview as you tweak noise, falloff, and color mapping

- Example 2: Game of Life (cellular automaton) with UI
  - Purpose: adjust grid size, update rules, or initial density and observe evolution
  - Typical usage (illustrative):
    - Open TheGameofLife.html
    - Use QuickSettings-like UI to tweak:
      - panel.addRange("cellSize", 2, 20, 6, 1, v => { ... })
      - panel.addBoolean("wrap", true, v => { ... }) or similar
      - Bind values to grid/state via getValue/setValue helpers
  - Output: evolving grid visuals with configurable cell size and wrap behavior

- Example 3: Flow-field particles
  - Purpose: visualize particle movement along a Perlin/noise-generated vector field
  - Typical usage (illustrative):
    - panel = QuickSettings.create(10, 10, "FlowField", document.body)
    - panel.addRange("scl", 10, 40, 20, 1, v => { scl = v; })
    - panel.addRange("particles", 100, 5000, 1000, 1, v => { resetParticles(v) })
  - Output: particles following a dynamic flow field with real-time parameter control

- Example 4: L-system fractals and trees
  - Purpose: control growth rules, angle, depth, and recursion
  - Typical usage (illustrative):
    - panel.addRange("angle", 5, 45, 25, 1, v => { angle = v; })
    - panel.addRange("depth", 1, 12, 6, 1, v => { maxDepth = v; })
  - Output: evolving branching structures that respond to UI controls

- Example 5: Space Invaders / Snake (classic arcade-style demos)
  - Purpose: tweak speeds, spawn rates, and enemy behavior in real time
  - Typical usage (illustrative):
    - panel.addRange("shipSpeed", 1, 10, 4, 1, v => { ship.speed = v })
    - panel.addRange("enemyFireRate", 1, 60, 15, 1, v => { enemies.fireRate = v })
  - Output: responsive arcade interactions with live parameter changes

Technical stack and architecture (brief)
- Language: JavaScript (ES6+)
- Rendering: p5.js (canvas-based)
- UI: QuickSettings-inspired lightweight UI embedded in sketches
- Data model: grid-based simulations (2D arrays), entity/state objects for games
- Procedural generation: island/terrain presets, color palettes
- Modularity: sketches are organized by feature (Life, Snake, SpaceInvaders, IslandGenerator, FlowField, Fractals, etc.)
- Packaging: Each sketch is standalone with its own HTML wrapper and supporting JS modules
- No backend: fully client-side, browser-based, no server required

File structure (high-level)
- HTML wrappers
  - TheGameofLife.html, Snake.html, SpaceInvaders.html, Sketch.html, IslandGenerator.html, etc.
- JavaScript modules
  - sketch.js (Game of Life)
  - snake.js (Snake)
  - ship.js, enemy.js, drop.js (Space Invaders)
  - IslandGenerator-related modules (NoiseSettings.js, GeneratorSettings.js, color palettes)
  - Flow field, particles, L-systems, fractals, etc.
- Utilities
  - 2D grid helpers (Make2DArray, index calculations)
  - Color utilities and palette mappings
  - LocalStorage helpers for saving/loading UI configurations

How to extend or remix
- Create a new HTML wrapper (e.g., MyExperiment.html) and a corresponding JS module (myExperiment.js)
- Use the QuickSettings-like API to expose parameters
  - Create a panel:
    - const panel = QuickSettings.create(10, 10, "MyExperiment", document.body);
  - Bind parameters to your sketch state:
    - panel.addRange("speed", 0, 10, 2, 0.1, v => { sketchState.speed = v; });
    - panel.addColor("bgColor", "#000000", v => { sketchState.bgColor = v; });
    - panel.saveInLocalStorage("my-experiment");
- Reuse the grid utilities and color palettes from IslandGenerator for grid-based simulations
- Leverage the getValuesAsJSON/setValuesFromJSON for exporting/importing configurations

Technical notes and practical tips
- Open in a modern browser (no server required)
- Use the localStorage features to persist your favorite configurations
- If you add new UI controls, think in terms of:
  - What sketch property does it map to?
  - What callback should trigger redraw or recomputation?
- For performance, keep heavy operations off the UI thread where possible and batch state updates
- The island generator presets (MountainIsland, VolcanicIsland, CoralAtoll, ArcticIsland, etc.) provide quick starting points for terrain exploration

Quickstart tips (minimal)
- Open any HTML wrapper in your browser:
  - TheGameofLife.html
  - IslandGenerator.html
  - The others (Snake.html, SpaceInvaders.html, Sketch.html, etc.)
- Use the on-page UI to tweak parameters and observe changes in real time
- Save your preferred configurations to localStorage and reload later

Limitations and considerations
- Browser-based, client-side only; no server-side persistence beyond localStorage
- Performance depends on canvas size, browser, and device capabilities
- The QuickSettings-like UI is lightweight and intended for educational/exploratory use
- Some older browsers may have limited support for certain input types (date/time). Fallbacks are provided (text inputs) where needed

If youâ€™d like, I can:
- Create a compact, ready-to-run starter example showing how to wire a new sketch to the QuickSettings UI
- Provide a cheat-sheet mapping common UI calls to their effects in the sketches
- Add a catalog of all sketches with one-liner descriptions and quick code snippets for common tweaks

This README emphasizes what the project can do, practical usage, and how the components interact. Itâ€™s designed to help you quickly understand capabilities and start experimenting, remixing, or extending the suite.
